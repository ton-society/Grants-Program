**Liquidity Reward Program**
**What is it?**

- Liquidity Reward Program to deploy upwards of $50M in Toncoin to teams launching projects on TON that increase the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the ecosystem.
- Eligible projects include: DEX & Bridge.
- Rewards will be distributed to any eligible project that registers regardless of whether or not they have already launched a project in the TON Ecosystem at the time of Program Announcement.
- Rewards will be distributed quarterly based on buckets of TVL that double for each bucket. As a project doubles their TVL, their reward will also double.
- The Program is designed to retroactively reward the best projects in the ecosystem on an ongoing basis to attract and maintain TVL within the TON Ecosystem.

**Summary & Explanation:**

- Project is ongoing subject to adjustments on a quarterly basis.
- Rewards will be distributed based on buckets of TVL.
- Each TVL Bucket will be double the previous bucket. As a project doubles their TVL, their reward will also double.
- Rewards will be calculated as 2% of the annual TVL.
- TVL will be calculated based on data from https://defillama.com/chain/TON
- TVL will be calculated by taking a daily snapshot of Total TVL in DefiLlama as an (prorated) average over the course of the quarter, Even if the project started after the Quarter began.
- TVL will be calculated in USD.
- Rewards Payouts will be distributed in TONcoin (measured in USD).
- Rewards Payouts will occur quarterly and be paid in TON, measured in USD value of TON with a 30 day Time Weighted Average price for TON.
- Rewards Payouts will be subject to a 3 month lockup period from the reward date (End of Quarter term).
- On a quarterly Basis projects will be promoted or relegated to the appropriate bucket based on their TVL contribution in that time period.
- The calculations for TVL will begin on January 21st, 2023 and be measured quarterly thereafter.
- To be Eligible for the Program projects must register.
- To be Eligible for the Program projects must have their data available on DefiLlama

**Example:**

- I launch my Dex on Feb 1, 2023 and register for TOC.
- On March 31 (End of Quarter term) my daily average TVL calculated on DefiLlama is $30M - This places me in the $20M+ bucket.
- Quarterly payment for this bucket is $100K ($400K annual at 2% of $20M bucket).
- Because I registered one third of the way through he quarter, my *prorated* reward is $66.66K for the months of February and March.
- The Time Weighted average for one month prior to the end of quarter (month of March) is $3 for TON.
- By mid April I get $66.67K worth of TON (22.2222 TON).
- This TON is vested linearly over the next 3 months from April 1st (Reward date, not payout date) to July 30th, 2022
- In Q2 I will be paid for all three months in the quarter. 
  - If I maintain over $20M TVL I will remain in the same Bucket.
  - If I am below $20M TVL I will be relegated to the $10M Bucket. 
  - If I achieve an average higher than $40M daily TVL I will be promoted to the next bucket and my reward will double.
  - If I am relegated below the first bucket ($5M TVL daily average) I will receive nothing in Q2.
